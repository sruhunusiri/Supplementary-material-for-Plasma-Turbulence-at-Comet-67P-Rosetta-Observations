# Supplementary-material-for-Plasma-Turbulence-at-Comet-67P-Rosetta-Observations
This repository contains supplementary material to Suranga Ruhunusiri, "Turbulence Characterization at Comet 67P: Rosetta Observations", submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, 2020.

The repository contains MATLAB programs for reading Rosetta magnetometer data, computing power spectra for magnetic field fluctuations and determine spectral parameters that are useful for characterizing plasma turbulence at comet 67P. Detail descriptions of the files are provided below:

1. A MATLAB program for reading Rosetta magnetometer data: RPCMAG_data_reader.m [3 kB]

2. A MATLAB program for computing magnetic field power spectrum and spectral parameters (spectral break frequency and spectral indices): RPCMAG_data_analysis.m [12kB]
